# RasCorder
A raspberry pi based star trek tricorder with emmision spectrometre, environmental monitoring and more.


# Work in Progress, more details and files coming soon!

What is this?

This is based on the work of the open source tricorder projects, housed in a case remixed from the markX tricorder found on thingiverse. The goal is to put as many sensors as possible into an attractive little case and use a raspberry pi to power the whole thing. 

What can it detect?
So far it seems like this should detect: spectral emmisions, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, UV Index, IR, Visible light, Some dangerous gases, and sound levels.
